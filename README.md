## Introduction

In this repository, I solve different recursion problems using Java. The exercises range from basic to more advanced recursion topics.

## Exercises

- [00. Basic Example of Recursive Factorial](src/Factorial.java)
- [00. Basic Example of Recursive Mult with Sums](src/RecursiveSum.java)
- [01. Recursive Power](src/RecursivePower.java)
- [02. Recursive Prime Number](src/IsPrime.java)
- [03. Digit Count](src/DigitCount.java)
- [04. Prime Factors Generator](src/PrimeFactors.java)
- [05-12. Class Sequence (search, order, find element working in collections)](src/SequenceClass.java)
- [95. Fractal of Snowcups](src/SnowcupsFractal.java)
- More exercises will be added here as I progress.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Java files in your favorite IDE.
3. Run the Java files to see the recursion in action!
